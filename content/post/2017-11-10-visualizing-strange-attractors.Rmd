# What is a strange attractor?

The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor) on attractors gives the following definition/explanation:

> An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together. Thus a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor.

So for a dynamical system, which is usually a solution to a system of differential equations, we have some solutions which are called attractors. Describe attractors...
