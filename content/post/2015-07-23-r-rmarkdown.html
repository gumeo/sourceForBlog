<div id="starting-a-blog" class="section level1">
<h1>Starting a blog</h1>
<p>The plan is to try to do weekly to monthly blogposts about something interesting I learn. I might also write up technical details about setting something up as a reference for my future self.</p>
<p>I chose to use the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> package to manage this blog, with the hugo theme <a href="http://dplesca.github.io/purehugo/"><code>purehugo</code></a>. The main reason I chose this is because I think it scales well for mobile devices and it looks clean and minimal. I will probably add an about section and some other stuff/fluff later.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that I start a blog, I also have my own <a href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~guei/">academic page/blog</a>. I just donâ€™t post there regularly. Removing some of the overhead, by managing the content/posts as Rmarkdown documents, will hopefully make me more productive as a blogger.</p>
